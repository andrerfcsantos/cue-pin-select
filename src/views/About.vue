    <h1>What is Cue-Pin-Select?</h1>
    <p>
      Cue-Pin-Select (CPS) is a mental password manager originally described by
      <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01781231/document"
        >this paper</a
      >. It describes a process to generate many passwords from a passphrase, a
      pin, and a cue per service/password to be created. The passphrase and pin
      should be kept secret and should be memorized. The cues don't necessarly
      need to be stored safely.

      CPS gives a process to generate passwords mentally that is easy to follow
      and should be memorized. When the process is memorized, one can generate
      passwords by applyting the process mentally, without any help from pen and
      paper or any websites (like this one!). This site intends to help users
      getting used to the process of generating password mentally using CPS. You
      should try to follow create CPS password without any help first. Use this
      site only to check you are getting the correct results. After a little
      practice creating passwords, you shouldn't need this website or any
      external help anymore :)
